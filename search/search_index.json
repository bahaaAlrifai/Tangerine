Its primary use is to enable offline data capture in low-resource areas. </p> <p>Tangerine was first developed to capture student responses in in oral early grade reading and mathematics skills assessments, specifically Early Grade Reading Assessment (EGRA) and Early Grade Mathematics Assessment (EGMA). As well as capture interview responses from students, teachers and principals on home and school context information. Tangerine's capabilities have been expanded for data capture and management for rural health intervention projects. </p> <p>Using Tangerine improves data quality and the efficiency of data collection and analysis by simplifying the preparation and implementation of field work, reducing measurement and data entry errors, and eliminating manual data entry from paper forms. </p> <p>Tangerine was developed in 2011 by RTI International with its own internal research funds, and made available to the public through a GNU General Public License. RTI redesigned Tangerine and developed a new codebase using latest technologies in 2018 with funding support from Google.org. As an open source software platform Tangerine's source code is available for anyone who wishes to install and use Tangerine on their own web server. Tangerine's source code and related documentation is available on Github, a commonly used repository for open source software.

There are now three different possible storage configurations for Tangerine:</li> <li>\"encryptionPlugin\":\"CryptoPouch\" - Configures the app to use CryptoPouch, which encrypts documents in the app's indexedb for storage.</li> <li>\"turnOffAppLevelEncryption\": true - Configures the app without encryption, using the app's indexedb for storage instead of sqlite/sqlCypher.</li> <li>\"encryptionPlugin\":\"SqlCipher\" - or without any additional configuration (SqlCipher is the default configuration.) - Configures the app to use SqlCipher, which encrypts documents in an external sqlLite database for storage.</li> <li>We have changed how we determine which storage engine is being used. In the past we exposed a window['turnOffAppLevelEncryption']   global variable based on the same flag in app-config.json; however, now we are determining in app-init.ts which engine is running and exposing either <code>window['cryptoPouchRunning']</code> or <code>window['sqlCipherRunning']</code> to indicate which engine is running. It is important to note that even the app is configured with <code>encryptionPlugin:'CryptoPouch'</code> in app-config.json, the app may have been installed without that setting and is actually running sqlCypher. This is why it is important to observe if either <code>window['cryptoPouchRunning']</code> or <code>window['sqlCipherRunning']</code> is set. </li> </ul> <p>Backports/Good to Know</p> <p>When we add new features or fix issues in patch releases of Tangerine, those code changes usually get added automatically to any new  releases of Tangerine. To make sure users of new releases are aware of those changes, we will occasionally mention them in  this section in case they have missed them in the Changelog for the corresponding earlier release.

When logged into the server and in a group, you will now find a \"Download CSV Data Set\" menu item under \"Data\". From there you can view all of the CSV Data Sets you have generated in the past, the status of wether or not they have finished generating, a link to download them, and other meta data. Click the \"New Data Set\" button and you will be able to select any number of forms to generate CSVs for, data for all time or a specific month, and wether or not to exclude PII. This is especially useful for generating CSVs that take longer to generate than the automatic logout built into the server. You may request a CSV Data Set, log out, and then log back in later to check in on the status and download it. A Server Administrator can also configure cron with a <code>generate-csv-data-set</code> command to generate a data set on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis, handy for situations where you want CSVs to automatically generate on the weekend and then download them on Monday. (Ticket: https://github.com/Tangerine-Community/Tangerine/issues/2768) (PR: https://github.com/Tangerine-Community/Tangerine/pull/2777)</li> <li>Data Manager archives a Case to remove it from reporting output and Devices. This adds an \"archive\" button on Cases that flags all related Form Responses as archived and removes them from CSV output and Search on Devices. This uses the new T.case.archive() API which adds an 'archived' flag for those docs and saves a minimal version of the doc with enough data to be indexed on the server. Search on client and server CSV output are modified to filter archived docs. When viewing cases in Editor, displays \"Archived\" when viewing an archived case. When client syncs, it deletes any docs with the 'archived' flag and sets deletedArchivedDocs In the replicationStatus log. (Ticket: https://github.com/Tangerine-Community/Tangerine/issues/2843) (PR: https://github.com/Tangerine-Community/Tangerine/pull/2776)</li> <li>Devices Manager reconfigures claimed Device sync settings and selects multiple Sync Locations for a Device. Details: To change a Device's sync settings currently requires a reinstall of the app on the Device and setting up all the accounts again. This PR will allow system admins to change the sync settings for a Device which then triggers on next sync a Rewind Push, database delete, then a first pull with the new sync settings. Subsequent syncs then use the new sync settings. This PR also refactors the Create and Edit forms for Devices on the server so that multiple sync locations can be added. (Ticket: https://github.com/Tangerine-Community/Tangerine/issues/2867) (PR: #2782)</li> <li>Device Manager estimates how large an initial sync will be given selected sync settings. When setting up sync settings for a Device, it is useful to know how many documents will need to be downloaded given which forms are configured for syncing down and the locations assigned. There is now a \"calculate down-sync size\" button at the bottom of Device edit/creation forms that when pressed will tally up the documents needing to be down synced given the device sync settings. (Ticket: https://github.com/Tangerine-Community/Tangerine/issues/2845) (PR: https://github.com/Tangerine-Community/Tangerine/pull/2818)</li> <li>Devices Manager monitors for Devices close to filling up disk space. Devices now report how much free space they have to the server after a sync. This can be monitored on the <code>Deploy &gt; Devices</code> list. When a Device reports having less than 1GB free storage, a warning is shown on the Devices list. (Ticket: 2779) (PR: 2795)</li> <li>Server User views the version of Tangerine installed. Any user on the server can now view the version of Tangerine installed by going to Help menu in the left nav bar. (Ticket: https://github.com/Tangerine-Community/Tangerine/issues/2846) (PR: https://github.com/Tangerine-Community/Tangerine/pull/2794)</li> <li>Database Consumer accesses Tangerine MySQL databases via web browser. Users of Tangerine's MySQL database sometimes are not allowed to install tools such as MySQL Workbench on their work computers. This PR makes starting PHPmyAdmin (a mysql viewer) as a web service a configuration option in Tangerine so no one has to install software on their computer to access Tangerine MySQL. (Ticket: https://github.com/Tangerine-Community/Tangerine/issues/2847) (PR: https://github.com/Tangerine-Community/Tangerine/pull/2793)</li> <li>Data Collector creates Account on Device and associates with any User Profile in Group (ignoring Device assignment/sync settings).  By default, when a Data Collector creates an Account on Device, they can only associate with User Profiles that are assigned to the same location as the Device's Assigned Location. Add <code>\"disableDeviceUserFilteringByAssignment\":true</code> to the app-config.json for the group and this restriction will be removed. Tablets will also sync all User Profiles, ignoring the Device's configured Sync Location(s). (Ticket: https://github.com/Tangerine-Community/Tangerine/issues/2848) (PR: https://github.com/Tangerine-Community/Tangerine/pull/2792)</li> <li>Form Developer writes code that can access Case's related Location metadata without writing asynchronous code. When working synchronously in forms, we don't currently have access to the related Location Node data without loading the Location List async and using T.case.case.location to search the hierarchy for the node we want. This PR loads all related Location Nodes into memory at T.case.location when the context of a Case is set. (Ticket: https://github.com/Tangerine-Community/Tangerine/issues/2849) (PR: https://github.com/Tangerine-Community/Tangerine/pull/2791)</li> <li>Server Administrator configures substitutions for CSV output. This feature allows a Server Administrator to update the group's configuration in the app database to contains Regex string replacements for CSV output. This can be handy in situations where Data Analysts are having trouble parsing CSV data that contains line breaks and commas. An example configuration to remove line breaks and commas from data would be <code>\"csvReplacementCharacters\": [{\"search\": \",\", \"replace\": \"|\"}, {\"search\": \"\\n\", \"replace\": \"___\"}]</code>. (Ticket: https://github.com/Tangerine-Community/Tangerine/issues/2787) (PR: https://github.com/Tangerine-Community/Tangerine/pull/2788)</li> <li>Server Administrator configures Tangerine to not auto-commit in groups' data directories to preserver manually managed git content repositories. When using git to manage group content in a git flow like manner, the automatic commit can result in unnintentional commits. System Administrators can now turn off this auto-commit by configuring Tangerine's <code>config.sh</code> with <code>T_AUTO_COMMIT=\"false\"</code>. If set to true also include the frequency <code>T_AUTO_COMMIT_FREQUENCY=\"60000\"</code>  (Ticket: https://github.com/Tangerine-Community/Tangerine/issues/2614) (PR: https://github.com/Tangerine-Community/Tangerine/pull/2748)</li> <li>Data Collector proposes change to a Form on a Case. The issues feature that has been available on the server is now optionally also available on Devices by <code>\"allowCreationOfIssues\": true</code> to <code>client/app-config.json</code> for the group you want this enabled. Most of the features of Issues you are familiar with from the server are there, except for merging proposals which is not allowed. Issues from Devices are uploaded to the server where proposals can be merged by a Data Manager. We also streamlined the Issue creation and proposal process by skipping the page to fill out an issue title/description, and then forward them directly to creating a proposal. To aid in issue titles/descriptions that make sense, Content Developers can now add <code>templateIssueTitle</code> and <code>templateIssueDescription</code> to Case Definition files.  (Ticket: https://github.com/Tangerine-Community/Tangerine/issues/2850) (PR: https://github.com/Tangerine-Community/Tangerine/pull/2330) (Demo Video)</li> <li>Data Manager updates Issue Title and Issue Description Data Managers will now find a metadata tab on an Issue where they can update the Title, Description, and new \"Send to\" settings. (Issue: https://github.com/Tangerine-Community/Tangerine/issues/2851) (PR: https://github.com/Tangerine-Community/Tangerine/pull/2330)</li> <li>Data Manager sends an Issue to all Devices in Sync Area or specific Device When create/configuring an Issue, Data Managers now have the option to send an Issue to a specific location in a Sync Area, or send it to a specific Device by Device ID. (Ticket: https://github.com/Tangerine-Community/Tangerine/issues/2854) (PR: https://github.com/Tangerine-Community/Tangerine/pull/2330)</li> <li>Forms Developer defines custom logic for Device's search of Cases and Forms In some cases there are situations where the standard variables for searching do not cover all things we want searched, or there is a compound field we want to be searched. Adding a client/custom-search.js file allows the Forms Developer to hook into the map function used to generate the search index. (Ticket: https://github.com/Tangerine-Community/Tangerine/issues/2852) (PR: https://github.com/Tangerine-Community/Tangerine/pull/2740)</li> <li>Data Manager views list of Issues related to Case When viewing a Case on the server, the first screen when opened will now show a list of related Issues. (Ticket: https://github.com/Tangerine-Community/Tangerine/issues/2723) (PR: https://github.com/Tangerine-Community/Tangerine/pull/2573)</li> <li>Form Developer uses API to override Device User based access to Event Forms on a per Case Event basis Currently we can configure in a Case Definition the operation permissions on all instances of an Event Form. This change allows a Form Developer to write logic that would control those permissions on a per Event Form basis by setting the same <code>permissions</code> property on the Event Form itself. (Ticket: https://github.com/Tangerine-Community/Tangerine/issues/2624) (PR: https://github.com/Tangerine-Community/Tangerine/pull/2660)</li> <li>Form Developer configures Devices to skip optimization of database views not in use on Device. Some projects relying heavily on a custom app will find they do not use all of the standard Tangerine database views, thus they can be skipped during the data optimization phase after a sync. In <code>app-config.json</code>, you can add a new <code>doNotOptimize</code> property with a value as an array of views to skip. To discover what views your app is indexing, see the console logs from a device during the optimization phase. You may discover some views you can add to <code>doNotOptimize</code> to speed up that optmization process.

Comparison sync enables the Sync feature to compare all document id's on the local device with the server and uploads any missing documents. Rewind Sync resets the sync \"placeholder\" to the beginning, ensuring that all docs are synced. It doesn't actually re-upload all docs; it instead checks that all docs have been uploaded.

This release resolves that particular issue and provides ways to ensure that all tablets share the same data. We have implemented several ways to rectify and understand potential data inconsistencies across tablets in the field:</li> <li> <p>After updating the server to 3.16.0 and after updating and syncing the clients, the Device dashboard will now display the number of docs on each tablet (\"All Docs on Tablet\") and the number of docs according to the device's Location configuration (\"Form Responses on Tablet for Location\"). </p> <ul> <li>Depending on the Configure/Sync settings, the \"All Docs on Tablet\" count may be close, but not exactly the same, since not all forms may be synced to the tablets.</li> <li>The \"Form Responses on Tablet for Location\" count should be the same for all tablets that share the same location configuration. Please note that \"Form Responses on Tablet for Location\" count needs to be activated by adding <code>\"calculateLocalDocsForLocation\": true</code> to app-config.json; also note that it has not been widely tested and may be unstable. (If you activate this feature, you may also add <code>\"findSelectorLimit\"</code> to modify how many batches are used to calculate this value. Default is 200. Lower is safer but slower.) </li> </ul> <p>These data points may help in identifying data  inconsistencies. Remember - only after updating and syncing the tablets, will these new doc counts be populated with data in the Devices listing. Making a note of the document counts per tablet will help establish a baseline.   - Next step would be to run the new \"Force Full Sync\" feature, which is implemented in two ways:  - If you add the new <code>\"forceFullSync\" : true</code> setting in the group's app-config.json, the client will perform a full sync upon the next update. Since this takes time and Internet bandwidth, you may wish to notify users before enabling this feature. - When logging in as \"admin\" user on the client tablet, a new menu item called \"Admin Configuration\" will be visible below the \"Settings\" item. This new item enables manual operation of the \"Force Full Sync\" feature. It is labeled \"Pull all docs from the server\" in the user interface.   - You may adjust the settings for how many documents \"Force Full Sync\" downloads at a time by adjusting the <code>initialBatchSize</code> property in app-config.json. The default is 1000 documents per batch. This setting is also used when performing the initial load of documents on a tablet. - Tangerine Release Archives: Every Tangerine APK or PWA release is saved and tagged. If your site is configured for archives (which is the default), you may download previous Android releases. PR: #2567 - A \"Description\" field has been added to the Devices listing to faciliate identification of devices or groups of devices.  - Beta Release Mysql module: Data sync'd to Tangerine can be output to a MySQL database. Warning: This should not yet be deployed on a production server; the code for this feature is still in development. We recommend creating a separate server for the Tangerine/MySQL installation and replicate data from the production server to the Tangerine server that would provide the MySQL service.   Docs: <code>docs/system-administrator/mysql-module.md</code> PR: #2531 - Devices listing offers more information about the sync process, including version, errors, and sync duration.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Fixes - Changes to the sync code should improve sync stability and speed. #2592 You may configure certain sync properties:   - initialBatchSize = (default: 1000) Number of documents downloaded in the first sync when setting up a device.   - batchSize (default: 200) - Number of documents downloaded upon each subsequent sync.   - writeBatchSize = (default: 50) - Number of documents written to the tablet during each sync batch. - Updated tangy-form-editor to v7.6.4, which improves functionality of <code>duplicate entire section</code>. PR: #173 - Updates the Schedule View to use date-carousel 5.2.0 which provides unix timestamps instead of date strings. #2589 - Upgrade tangy-form to fix issue causing <code>on-open</code> of first items to not run when proposing changes in an Issue. - Deactivate App.checkStorageUsage if using Sync Protocol 2. This was not compatible and should not run. - Allow projects to disable GPS warming to save on battery with <code>disableGpsWarming</code> in <code>app-config.json</code>. - Add missing import of <code>editor/custom-scripts.js</code> when using editor so Data Dashboards can have imported JS files.</p> <p>Server upgrade instructions Reminder: Consider using the Tangerine Upgrade Checklist for making sure you test the upgrade safely.</p> <pre><code>cd tangerine\n# Check the size of the data folder.\ndu -sh data\n# Check disk for free space.

This method of deployment is suitable in slow network     environment or when the apk is large.</p> </li> <li> <p>Web Browser Installation. This deployment strategy requires an     Internet connection on the tablet for the Tangerine to be installed.     Once installed, the app can work again offline.

It is the data that is stored in the database when a user submits a Tangy Form. It is also the data that is returned when you call the dashboardService.getResponse() method.</p> <p>Tangerine modules - such as CSV and mysql - can be adapted to support different data structures in a TangyFormResponse.  The default case is to output a CSV file with a header row and a row for each TangyFormResponse.  The header row contains the names of the inputs in the TangyFormResponse. The data rows contain the values of the inputs in the TangyFormResponse.</p> <p>A register - such as an Attendance register used in Teach - is a snapshot of a list of things being tracked, such as students attending a class. (Contrast this to a typical TangyFormResponse that is a snapshot of form inputs.) A register is for collecting data about multiple people or objects, whereas a formResponse is collecting data for a single unit or participant.  An example of a register is a form of type 'attendance' or 'scores' which is used to collect data in the Attendance feature of the Teach module. There is a property called attendanceList that has an array of students.  When processing the changes feed, the csv module detects the 'attendance' type and creates a new row for each student in the attendanceList. </p> <p>In the case module context, a case definition manages participants and the forms submitted with data about each participant. A class project does not have a file similar to a case definition; it is more rigid and stores much of those relationships in the app logic. </p> <p>One could say a case is similar to a Class in Teach in that Teach saves metadata about a school, classes and students, but it is a rigid structure. A case is more flexible and can be used to track any type of data.</p>"},{"location":"developer/debugging-reporting/","title":"Debugging reporting","text":""},{"location":"developer/debugging-reporting/#debugging-the-reporting-cache-process","title":"Debugging the Reporting Cache process","text":"<p>Summary of steps:</p> <ol> <li>Turn on reporting modules in <code>config.sh</code>.</li> <li>Run develop.sh.</li> <li>Create a group.</li> <li>Generate data.</li> <li>Stop the keep alive for reporting worker by commenting out <code>this.keepAliveReportingWorker()</code> in <code>server/src/app.service.ts</code>.</li> <li>Enter the container on command line with <code>docker exec -it tangerine bash</code>.</li> <li>Clear reporting cache with command <code>reporting-cache-clear</code>.</li> <li>Run a batch with debugger enabled by running command <code>node --inspect-brk=0.0.0.0:9228 $(which reporting-worker-batch)</code>.</li> <li>Latch onto debugging session using Chrome inspect.

The afore-mentioned Wikipedia page offers some guidance: \"As an example, a one-way Boolean event flag is a trivial CRDT: one bit, with a value of true or false. True means some particular event has occurred at least once. False means the event has not occurred. Once set to true, the flag cannot be set back to false. (An event, having occurred, cannot un-occur.) The resolution method is \"true wins\": when merging a replica where the flag is true (that replica has observed the event), and another one where the flag is false (that replica hasn't observed the event), the resolved result is true \u2014 the event has been observed.\"</p> <p>We have not yet reached this level of conflict resolution. We have first started with comparing data from Event Forms, detecting some basic conflicts such as missing <code>formResponseId</code>, <code>complete</code>, or <code>required</code> properties or detecting if there is a <code>new</code> event form and then merging according to rules specific to each difference. In general, the event form conflicts are resolved by adding the missing property or form. For metadata that are in conflict, the most recent metadata is merged (wins).

When a user is proposing changes, the system unlocks an already completed form. Form Developers must be careful when writing logic they only expect to be ran once in a form.</p> <p>For example, setting a \"caseOpenedOn\" variable in the <code>on-open</code> of a form. When a form is reopened in an Issue, the logic could potentially overwrite the \"caseOpenedOn\" variable using the current date of the proposed change.  </p> <pre><code>&lt;tangy-form\n    on-open=\"\n        T.case.setVariable('caseOpenedOn', moment.now())\n    \"\n&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>This can be remedied by using the <code>T.case.isIssueContext()</code> helper function to ensure our variable setting does not happen in a reopen in the issue context.</p> <pre><code>&lt;tangy-form\n    on-open=\"\n        if (!T.case.isIssueContext()) {\n            T.case.setVariable('caseOpenedOn', moment.now())\n        }\n    \"\n&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>The same is true if you have any <code>&lt;tangy-form-item&gt;</code> level <code>on-open</code> or <code>on-change</code> logic that should not run in when being modified in an Issue.

Instead, if some code does need to run, place it in the <code>on-resubmit</code> code for a <code>&lt;tangy-form&gt;</code>.</p> <p>Note in the following example how we only set <code>caseOpenedOn</code> in <code>on-submit</code>. This ensure this variable will only be set once. However, note how put the setting of <code>firstName</code> and <code>lastName</code> in the <code>on-resubmit</code>. This ensures that if the proposed change to this Form Response changes the <code>firstName</code> or <code>lastName</code> values, the Case will be updated to reflect this proposed change.</p> <pre><code>&lt;tangy-form\n    on-submit=\"\n        T.case.setVariable('caseOpenedOn', moment.now())\n        T.case.setVariable('firstName', getValue('firstName'))\n        T.case.setVariable('lastName', getValue('firstName'))\n    \"\n    on-resubmit=\"\n        T.case.setVariable('firstName', getValue('firstName'))\n        T.case.setVariable('lastName', getValue('firstName'))\n    \"\n&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>There are also many input types such as GPS and Signature where it often does not make sense to recollect data upon submitting a proposal on an Issue.
